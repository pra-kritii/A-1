# A-1

#Task 1
input() → takes input from the user as a string.

int() → converts that string into an integer.

a → stores the first number.

b → stores the second number.

Then it performs basic arithmetic operations:

Addition → a+b

Subtraction → a-b

Multiplication → a*b

Division → a/b (gives float result, even if both are integers).


#Task 2
x → stores the user’s first name (string).

y → stores the user’s last name (string).

print() → displays a welcome message by joining them.
